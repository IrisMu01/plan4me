Bringing together the perspectives of cultures, arts and sciences, this exhibition reflects on what we value and how we preserve it.<p>The exhibition will be displayed in areas throughout the Museum, and visitors will have the opportunity to see the majestic poles of the Great Hall undergo important conservation work while they are temporarily stored in the adjacent O’Brian Gallery.<p><strong>Sunday, December 2, 2018 -
